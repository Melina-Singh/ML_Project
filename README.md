## Overview
This project aims to predict students' mathematics scores based on various factors influencing their performance. By analyzing data related to students' academic performance, parental education levels, meal consumption, writing and reading scores, and whether or not they have received tuition, we employ machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. 
The project utilizes various technologies and methodologies to enhance the prediction accuracy, ensuring a robust analysis of the factors affecting students performance.

The project follows a systematic approach to predict students' mathematics scores:

1. **Dataset**: The dataset, located in the `notebook` folder, contains features related to students' performance and external factors influencing their mathematics scores.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis involves visualizing distributions and identifying patterns to understand feature impacts on scores.

3. **Data Processing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and missing value handling for data integrity.

4. **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning algorithms are trained, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like Grid Search to optimize performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to ensure prediction accuracy.

6. **Predictive Pipeline and Flask Application**: A predictive pipeline is developed for seamless predictions, alongside a Flask app for user interaction, enabling input of features for score predictions.




## Docker and GitHub Actions for CI/CD Pipeline

### Docker
Docker is utilized to containerize the application, allowing for consistent and isolated environments. This approach simplifies dependencies management and ensures that the application runs reliably across different platforms.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is implemented to automate the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. It triggers workflows on code changes, automatically building, testing, and deploying the application. This integration helps maintain code quality and facilitates quick iterations.


### Workflow
The CI/CD workflow is activated by pushes or pull requests to the main branch. It includes several key steps:
- **Build**: The Docker image is built, packaging the application and its dependencies.
- **Test**: Automated tests are executed within the Docker container to ensure code functionality.
- **Linting**: Code quality checks are performed using tools like Flake8, identifying potential issues early.
- **Deploy**: Upon successful completion of tests and linting, the application is deployed, allowing users to access the latest version seamlessly.
